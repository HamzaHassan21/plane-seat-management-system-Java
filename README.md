# Plane Seat Management System (Java)

This is a console-based Java application developed as part of a university coursework assignment.
The program simulates a simple plane seat management system, allowing users to manage seat bookings
through a menu-driven interface.

## Overview

The application manages airplane seating using a two-dimensional array to represent rows and seats.
Users can interact with the system via the console to perform common seat management operations.

## Features

- Buy a seat
- Cancel a seat
- Find the first available seat
- Display the seating plan
- Input validation with exception handling
- Menu-driven user interface

## Technologies Used

- Java
- 2D Arrays
- Control Flow (Loops & Conditionals)
- Exception Handling
- Console-based Input/Output

## Project Context

This project was completed during my university studies to demonstrate understanding of
fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and user input handling in Java.

## What I Learned

- Representing real-world problems using data structures
- Managing application state within a program
- Validating user input and handling runtime exceptions
- Writing readable and structured Java code

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in any Java-compatible IDE
3. Compile and run the `W2044381_HamzaHassan_PlaneSeatManagement` class
4. Follow the on-screen menu options

## Notes

This project is included for academic and learning purposes and reflects my early experience
with Java and software development.
